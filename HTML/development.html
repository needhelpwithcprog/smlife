              <p>My three strengths include improving my speech, participating in class frequently, and building my confidence. </p><br></br>
              <p><b> Improving My Speech </b> - Over the past five years, I always get nervous if I have a presentation or an oral speech to do. <br>
               However, I joined a club that requires you to speak up or advocate for something, and with the help of my friends, I slowly became <br>
               comfortable speaking fluently. </br></p>

              <p><b>Participating in class frequently </b> - In the past, I rarely participate in class unless the teacher asked me to answer a specific question. <br>
                This is because I was afraid I would say an incorrect answer and embarrass myself. However, I realized that when I participate in class, <br>
                I would learn from my mistake and become better at what I do. </br></p>

              <p><b>Building my confidence </b> - With the improvement in my speech as well as participation in activities, it contributes to building my confidence. <br>
              I am not afraid of speaking out or shying away from the responsibilities given to me. </br></p>               


              <a font size="7" name= "Middle"</font><h1><u>Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</u></h1>

              <p>In Chapters 4 - 7, four main pillars stood out. These are Achieve Your Goals, The Proper Use of Time, Surrounding Yourself With <br>
                 The Best People and Be a Life Long Learner. </p>
            
              <p><b>Achieve Your Goals </b> - Setting a personal goal is a major reason for accomplishing that goal. You know where you are presently <br>
                 and in order to be where you want to be, you must change directions at some point in your life. </br></p>    

              <p><b>The Proper Use of Time </b> - In Chapter 5, two types of pain were mentioned, the pain of discipline and the pain of regret. <br>
                 The pain of regret weighs more because you are regretful for not capturing those opportunities. It is best for you to make use of <br>
                 these opportunities than letting them slip away. </br></p>    
  
              <p><b>Surrounding Yourself With The Best People </b> - The kind of people that you have in your life influences your decision. Surrounding yourself <br>
                 with hardworking and dedicated people who are aiming to achieve their goals, will help you to grow as a person. Rather than <br>
                 being around people who have no future, stick around those who you would be there within 5 to 10 years. </br></p>    

              <p><b>Be A Life Long Learner </b> - Having a formal education is not the end of the journey for you but having self-education <br>
                 is the key to success. Searching and learning is important for self-education, as well as observing and reflecting on your mistakes. </br></p>  

                
              <p>All four pillars that were mentioned can be applied in my life by reflecting on them, however, chapters 5 and 6 stood out the most. <br> I have to reflect on how I manage my time between school
                 and other factors. Whenever an opportunity comes knocking on my door, <br> I must make use of it. Anyone that is in my life that has a bad energy would slowly leave my life.  </p>
